    "info": "The Intermountain Healthcare Bilirubin Risk Chart App is based on Intermountain’s HELP2 application of the same name. This app is for demonstration purposes only and is not approved for clinical use. It was created to highlight the concept of the HSPC model, which creates a method of sharing clinical applications currently locked up in a single organization or EHR vendor and make it available to all healthcare providers.\n\rJaundice occurs in most newborn infants. Most jaundice is benign, but because of the potential toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia and, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. Although kernicterus should almost always be preventable, cases continue to occur. The focus of this app is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment.\n\rBy overlaying bilirubin [Mass/volume] results over a time-based risk chart, clinicians are presented with a visual representation of the results and associated criticality zones. By viewing the results in this way, the clinician can determine the best course of action based on the recommended intervention for the criticality of the result."

    "info": "The widely-used Reynolds Risk Score is used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual. For patients and clinicians alike, this calculation is often reported in an esoteric, hard-to-read lab report.\n\rFor our model of an improved Reynolds Risk Score reporting SMART App, we took an inspired Creative Commons design, the work of designer David McCandless, whose “Blood Work Cardiology Result” appeared in the Wired Magazine article “The Blood Test Gets a Makeover” (Wired 18.12, December 2010) and was published under a Creative Commons license. The resulting SMART Cardiac Risk app presents relevant patient vitals and lab measurements and the calculated Reynolds Risk Score, along with a succinct, patient-friendly explanation for each result. The app’s presentation produces a highly attractive document to hand to a patient. Furthermore, the SMART Cardiac Risk app also offers simulation: the clinician (or patient) can make changes to one or more of the patient’s vitals or lab results to see how the patient’s current Reynolds Risk Score could be improved."

Since neonatal sepsis could explain a positive NTS screen, either a general score (Clinical Score for Neonatal Sepsis) or a score specific for a subtype of neonatal sepsis (early-onset versus late-onset), such as the LateOnset Neonatal Sepsis Score, can be used to further gauge the probability of sepsis."
